# sfmt-erlang: SIMD-oriented Fast Mersenne Twister (SFMT) for Erlang

## Security notice regarding the PHP mt_seed() vulnerability

Ambionics Security published [an internal state retrieval algorithm of PHP `mt_rand()`](https://www.ambionics.io/blog/php-mt-rand-prediction) on 6-JAN-2020. sfmt-erlang uses the same seed-to-internal-state initialization algorithm at the function `init_gen_rand/1`.

For reducting the possibility of the internal state revelation, use `init_by_list32/1` instead, better combined with `rand:uniform/1`. [Raimo Niskanen published a piece of code for this purpose](http://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2018-July/095875.html).

*Note well that sfmt-erlang has no cryptographic security guarantee and MUST NOT be used for security purposes such as password generation.*

Also: Version 0.13.0 and 0.13.1 Erlang and C code files are identical. Users have no need to upgrade.

Thanks to Shiro Kawai for the notification of the seed initialization algorithm issue. 

## Travis CI build status for the master branch

## Details of SFMT algorithm

This software is based on SFMT ver. 1.3.3 (SIMD oriented Fast Mersenne
Twister(SFMT)) by Mutsuo Saito (Hiroshima University) and Makoto Matsumoto
(Hiroshima University). See
<http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/SFMT/index.html> for the further details.

Note well: only (2^19937 - 1) period is supported.

## Available modules

* module `sfmt`: SFMT with C NIFs
* module `sfmt_pure`: SFMT with pure Erlang
* See [CHANGES.md](https://github.com/jj1bdx/sfmt-erlang/blob/master/CHANGES.md) for the detail of miscellaneous changes

## C NIFs

* Compiler requirement: C99 support (modern Clang and gcc will do): `<inttypes.h>` required
* See `c_src/sfmt_nif.c` for the details
* Also refer to sfmt-extstate at <http://github.com/jj1bdx/sfmt-extstate>
* The version number of this NIF is 101 (see `NIF_LOAD_INFO` macro value)

## Tested platforms

* FreeBSD/amd64 11.1-PRERELEASE with Erlang/OTP 20.0
* macOS 10.12.5 with Erlang/OTP 20.0

## Make options (of erlang.mk)

* `Makefile` works on both BSD/GNU make
* `Makefile.sfmt` is the real GNU make file; edit this file for modification
* Building: `make`
* C NIF Documentation: `make c_doc` (requires Doxygen 1.8.3.1 or later)
* Erlang Documentation: `make docs`
* Testing: `make tests`
* Execution speed benchmark: `make speed`
* See also [erlang.mk](https://github.com/extend/erlang.mk) for the details

## hex.pm support

* NIF building errors fixed (0.12.7 and later)
* Package name: `sfmt`
* See `mix.exs`
* Note: all builds including C and Erlang source compilation are done with `make` with `erlang.mk`

## API compatible with the rand module

    seed/3, uniform/0, uniform/1, uniform_s/1, uniform_s/3 

## On HiPE usage

* sfmt module is NIFnized so does not coexist with HiPE
* On the other hand, `sfmt_pure` module can be compiled with HiPE or `+native "+{hipe, [o3]}"` erlc compile option, which will result in 40% to 100% speedup on 64-bit machines

## TODO

* No more new feature; more load testing needed
* More documentation
* Code upgrading/reloading behavior check
